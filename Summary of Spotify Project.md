For a class project in my Data Analytics course, I explored a dataset of the Top Spotify Songs from 2023. The goal was to perform various aggregations and analyses on a tabular dataset of my choice. I focused on uncovering patterns between different musical features.

Using Python and data visualization libraries, I examined relationships between variables such as danceability, energy, musical key, and more. One of the most interesting insights was a correlation between a songâ€™s speechiness (a measure of spoken words in music) and its release year, suggesting a possible trend toward more spoken-word or rap-influenced music in recent years.

The project includes:

Summary statistics and aggregations

Correlation analysis

Visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, etc.)

Key takeaways from the data
