This is a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game that I developed freshman-year of college in my Introduction to Computing class. I devloped features such as input valadation, win detection, and an efficient game loop to ensure smooth gameplay. It implements graphics.py to assist with visuals while tracking the players mouse coordinants to block off the boxes with X's and O'x.
